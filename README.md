# Todo

Todo is a sample microservice application consisting of services based on .NET Core, MongoDB.


**How to start the application?**
----------------

Todo Service can be started locally via `dotnet run` (executed in the `/src/Todo.Api` directory), by default it will be available under http://localhost:5000.

And also Identity Service can be started locally via `dotnet run` (executed in the `/src/Todo.Services.Identity` directory), by default it will be available under http://localhost:5010.

It is required to have the basic infrastructure up and running first ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
